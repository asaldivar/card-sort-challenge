# Card Sort

Coding challenge for Happy Returns. Implements topological sort on a DAG to sort a series of boarding cards with origin and destination information in linear time and space, O(|V|+|E|) where |V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges.

Note that the requirements of the problem guarantee that there are not multiple paths to a final destination (no cities can be repeated).
